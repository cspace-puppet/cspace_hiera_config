#
# The following are default values for a generic CollectionSpace
# server installation.
#
# If you want to change these values when installing a specific instance of
# a server, we recommend that you copy the relevant line(s) below to the
# collectionspace_instance.yaml file, and then change their values there,
# in that file. That way, you can preserve the default values in this
# file: both for reference, and as sensible fallbacks if needed.
#
# Hierarchy of value overrides:
#
# Values in the collectionspace_instance.yaml file override those in this
# file, collectionspace_common.yaml.
#
# Both, in turn, are overridden by values of corresponding environment
# variables, if any, on the host where the installation takes place. For
# instance, the value of an ANT_OPTS environment variable, if present,
# would override the value of collectionspace::ant_opts, below. And
# similarly, CATALINA_HOME would override collectionspace::catalina_home.
#
collectionspace::ant_opts: -Xmx1524m
collectionspace::catalina_home: /usr/local/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.64
collectionspace::catalina_opts: -Xmx1024m
collectionspace::catalina_pid: /usr/local/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.64/bin/tomcat.pid
# The cspace_instance_id's default value is "_default".
# Custom, per-instance values should also begin, by convention,
# with an underscore ("_").

collectionspace::cspace_jeeserver_home: /usr/local/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.64
collectionspace::jee_port: 8180

# Any password values not supplied here in Hiera configuration, or in
# environment variables on the local host, will be automatically generated.
